# Arthur's Pharmacy

This website was created for the required Milestone Project One for the Code Institutes Web Development Course using Bootstrap template "Freelancer"

The live website can be found [here](https://hart11.github.io/final-project/)

I wanted to build a website for my own fictional pharmacy. The design is a simple and effective one page scrolling site with internal links to sections, with a contact form for users to get in touch with enquires. 
Important to be aware that all pharmacies are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GB) and require a registration logo with registration number. This has NOT been included. 

<br><br>

## Arthur's Pharmacy Overview
***
The site provides interactive modals demonstrating the services this fictional pharmacy can provide. Colours of images lure the user in. The site would allow a user to sign up to arrange prescription delivery, or wish to find out more information. This is done through a contact form.

## Project Research 
***
Having recently acquired my own allotment and researching the topic, I have presented the information in such a way that is ideal for beginners and less daunting compared to more "veteran" allotment websites. The knowledge presented is what I wish I had prior to having my own allotmment.
<br><br>

 ### Research Analysis
  ***
  There has been a massive increase of interest in allotment ownership, particularly through the pandemic. Waiting lists are a big thing for all allotment sites so encouraging people to sign up as early as possible will benefit them greatly as some waiting lists can be up to 10 years +
<br><br>

## User Experience Design
***
## User stories
<br>

#### First Time Visitor Goals

 - As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the allotment site and allotment ownership.
- As a First Time user, I want to be able to navigate throughout the site pages to find relevant content.
- As a First Time user, I want to view the website and content clearly on the device I am currently using and switch between devices and have the webpage be responsive.
- As a First Time user, I want to find out about the allotment site, how to get an allotment and some beginner tips.

### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a Returning user, I want to apply for an allotment, if I haven't already.
- As a Returning user, I want to contact the allotment owners to ask any questions I might have
- As a Returning user, I want to get a list of the equipment that I need and see what is available to buy in the allotment shop.

### Frequent Visitor Goals

- As a Frequent user, I want to check to see if there are any upcoming changes to the allotment site.
- As a Frequent user, I want to check what stock the allotment shop has or contact the allotment shop for them to order an item in for me.
- As a Frequent user, I want to view the image gallery to see if my allotment is being showcased.

 ## Features
 ***
 ## Existing Features 

<Br>

 * ### Navigation Bar
***
![Navbar](assets/images/navbar.png)
<br><br>
![Navbarmobile](assets/images/navbarmobile.png) ![navbaropen](assets/images/navbaropen.png)
<br><br>
  * The navigation bar is present across all three pages of the Sprouton Allotment website. It is fully responsive and includes links to the home page, image gallery and the waiting list application page. The navigation bar is in a fixed position therefore always visible to the user when scrolling the page. This is effective UX design, preventing the user to have to scroll back to the top of the page manually, or rely on auto-scroll buttons placed on the website.
  
  * The navigation bar shrinks to a "hamburger" icon and presents the links in a drop-down menu when the website is viewed on smaller screens such as a mobile phone or smaller tablet. I have changed the default hamburger icon to a plant related font awesome icon, in-keeping with the page design. This may be against UX design as users are familiar with the default hamburger icon. This was confirmed in user testing, however to add interactivity to the website I decided to keep the icon and make it "beat" so users will be attracted to click it. The animation stops once the button is pressed.

  * The current page is highlighted in green to notify the user of their current page and links change colour upon hover to notify the user the link is clickable.

  * The background image of the navigation bar is responsive and changes to a different image on smaller screens - this is for aesthetic reasons. I have applied a filter to the background image which allows for the links to easily stand out against the background and give the navigation bar a more professional look.
<br><br>

* ### The Home page
***

![Homepage](assets/images/homepage.png)


  - The Home page is broken up into sections. The first section is "Our Allotment Story" giving the user some background and current information regarding the allotment site. It also includes an embedded google map to show the location of the Allotment Site. I have used font awesome icons relevant to each section (the story book icon to represent the background story of the allotment site).
  The second section introduces the website visitor to the allotment committee - briefly explaining their role, names and contact information. I have included a photograph to allow existing site owners to recognise the committee members whenever they meet in person. This also gives new visitors to the site a prospective of the owners and the mutual ideals of the allotment site. 
  Each section is succinct as to give the user enough information without information overload.
  The third section of the website is about the allotment site itself. Giving the website user information on the number of allotments available, the sizes available and other important details about the site. This is accompanied by an image of the allotment site layout which gives new users their bearings and existing owners a handy map. 
  The fourth section gives the user information on the benefits of owning an allotment. I have included a video produced by the National Allotment Society, showcasing the benefits. This is included as to persuade new users to sign up for an allotment and remind existing owners about the numerous benefits of allotment ownership.
  
  - The next section is split into three parts - a getting started equipment guide, a growing guide and a stock list of the on-site allotment shop. I have presented the equipment list and allotment shop as modals that open upon clicking the corresponding button. The growing guide links to an external pdf provided by a well-established gardening company with permission to use. The modals have a close button to easily get back to the website behind and they can also be clicked away from if the user is on a desktop website. The headers of the modals are always visible to allow the user to quickly exit, rather than having to scroll back up the page.

  - The Home page is fully responsive.
<br><br>

* ### Image Gallery
***
![gallery](assets/images/gallery.png)


  - The image gallery page includes photographs of the allotment site, produce grown on the allotment and other relevant photos designed to visually explain the allotment site and encourage people to join the waiting list. 
  - The images are presented in a visually appealing grid box which is fully responsive (webpage is scrollable).
   <br><br>

* ### Waiting list application page
***
![apply](assets/images/apply.png)


  - This page of the site allows the site visitor to apply to join the waiting list for Sprouton allotments. It includes a relevant image (soil in a heart shape being held) with a form to gather the prospective owners information. The form is fully responsive. For design purposes, the image disappears on smaller screens so the form is the main focus for the user. The form makes use of the "required" attribute to ensure all required information is inputted by the user. Once complete the user can click the submit button which will take the user to a "thank you" page. The thank you page is included to provide feedback to the user that their request has been acknowledged. The thank you page opens in a new browser tab to prevent the user losing their place on the main website - it also includes links to return to the homepage or further information on contacting the allotment site owners.
  <br><br>
* ### Website Footer
***
![footer](assets/images/footer.png)

 - The footer present on each page of the website includes links to Sprouton Allotments social media pages. Each link will open in a new tab to allow the user to easily switch between the two and not lose their original position on the Sprouton Allotments website.
 I decided to keep the footer simple with just the social media links present - colour is in-keeping with the website colour scheme.
 - The links are facebook, instagram, twitter and YouTube. Copyright information is also displayed.
<br><br>

* ### Form Acknowledgement Page
***
![thanks](assets/images/thanks.png)

 - The form acknowledge page appears once a user has completed the form with all required fields containing the correct information. The page is a simple acknowledgement to the user with links to contact the allotment site or return to the homepage.
<br><br>

* ### 404 Error Page
***
 ![404](assets/images/404.png)
<br><br>

* ### Future Features
***
  * A members only section, allowing users to arrange seed-swaps, equipment loans etc.
  * Allotment shop - allowing users to buy online and collect their order when they are next on site, or have them delivered to their allotment.
<br><br>

## Design
***
   * ### Colour Scheme
      I wanted a colour scheme based around gardening colours - namely plant-greens and earthy browns. 
  * ### Favicon 
      I used the [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) website to create a favicon for my website. I wanted something simple and recognisable, related to gardening. I used font awesome for the icon and styled it - using favicon to produce the file.
  * ### Typography
      I wanted a cursive font for the website name/logo and subsequent headers through the page. I wanted a simple yet professional looking font for the paragraphs and other writings.
  * ### Imagery
      All imagery was sourced from pexels.com or google images, ensuring they had appropriate commercial licenses.

      I opted for images to fit with the website purpose. I wanted images that showcased gardens, allotments, vegetables and images in-keeping with the website colour scheme.
  * ### Layout
      I decided on a multi-page layout rather than one single flowing page. The bulk of the website information is presented on the homepage, which is neatly displayed using a bootstrap template which I have customised with my own CSS. The image gallery is designed to showcase the allotments from the allotment site, as well as produce grown on site and other images from around the allotments. All images are aesthetically pleasing and fit with the scope of the website.
<br><br>

## Test Strategy 
***

 ### Testing
  Testing for this website was done using the Microsoft Edge Browser and the built-in Chrome Developer Tools to check responsiveness on different screensizes and general debugging. Testing was also done on an iPhone 10 using Safari and Microsoft Edge. Testing was also carried out on a Microsoft Surface Pro 7 as I encountered some issues with landscape layout through the developer tools. No issues were found with responsiveness and previous issues have been dealt with through custom screen aspect media queries.
  
  In addition to my own testing, I sent my website link to family and friends and asked for them to test the website out using the same methods listed below.


The website contains no backend functionality therefore testing will concentrate on:

* Testing navigational links on each separate page, as well as the site logo which is designed to redirect to the home page
* Testing the responsiveness of the website, making sure the layout and navigational features remain user friendly with UX design maintained
* Testing of the form to ensure it functions correctly and does not allow an incomplete entry.
* Testing the form takes the user to the "thank you" page
* Testing out the "404" page if somehow the user manually keys in the website wrong or finds a broken link
* Testing the modals work correctly and display at all resolution breakpoints
* Testing the YouTube and Google map API links work correctly
* Testing the "growing list" link that should open up an external PDF file in a separate tab.
<br><br>

### User Stories Testing

***
   1. As a user visiting the site for the first time, I want to navigate the site quickly and efficiently.
   * Website visitor can navigate to the home page from any page in the website. This is either via the navigation menu, or the navbrand logo, as is standard on most websites.
   2. As a user, I want to know a brief history and story about the allotment site, any committee/manager involvement of the allotment site and other useful information.
   * Website visitor can browse the homepage which is broken up into sections. They are informed about the current allotment site, the committee team of the allotment, a site map of the allotment and other useful information about allotment ownership.
   * There is further information provided in modals on the homepage, detailing equipment needed, an on site shop and external information about growing produce.
   3. As a visitor, I want to view images of the allotment site and other related images such as vegetables grown on the site or the layout of other peoples allotments.
   * The website visitor can visit the image gallery page to view images of allotments, fruit/vegetables and other peoples allotments.
   4. As a visitor who is interested in owning an allotment, I wish to get on the waiting list for this allotment site.
   * The website visitor can apply to join the waiting list using the waiting list page. The page requires the user to fill in mandatory fields and presents the user with an acknowledgement once complete.
   5. As a user, I want to be able to contact the allotment site for further information without committing to the waiting list.
   * A user can contact the allotment site from a link on the homepage. They can also contact the allotment site from the thank you page once they have signed up for the waiting list.
   * A user can visit the allotment sites social media and contact the site via external means. These links are present in the footer bar on each page.
   6. As a website visitor, I want to know what items are available for sale in the on-site allotment shop. 
   * A visitor can click the allotment shop link on the home page and be presented with a current shop stock list and pricing.
   7. As a user, I want to be able to access your social media accounts.
   * A user can access the allotment site social media links via the footer in any of the pages that they find themselves on.
<br><br>

        <br><br>
      * Footer - Repeated steps on all pages.
        * Verify that the social media links open in a new tab.
        <br><br>

   ### Accessibility testing
***
  In order to test for accessibility, I used the windows program NVDA. NVDA is a screen reader software which reads out the webpage for visually impaired users. It also reads out clickable items on the webpage, any links, image descriptors, forms and buttons. Using this software I visited the live version of the website and allowed the screen reader to run through the whole website. There were no issues with the website in terms of accessibility. From running the software I noticed the footer bar links did not read out as they are only represented by a font awesome icon. I then added aria-labels in for each link to ensure accessibiilty is maintained throughout the website. The screen reader also highlighted the main buttons on the homepage (equipment list, growing list and allotment shop stock list) did not have appropriate labels - these were added accordingly.
<br><br>

  ### Feedback from User Testing
***
  The main piece of feedback from my user testing was in relation to the hamburger icon. Against UX design I have changed the icon to a plant rather than the traditional hamburger icon that people are familiar with. Some testers were not aware the plant represented a hamburger icon. To combat this, rather than changing the icon back to the traditional icon, I used the built in "beat" function that can be applied to font awesome icons. The icon now shows a "beating" animation which will draw the user to click the icon. Once the icon has been pressed, the icon stops beating, this was achieved using an "onclick" attribute on the icon which essentially removes the "fa-beat" from the span class once it has been opened. The beat will be re-applied if the user moves to another page or refreshes their current page, however the icon will have already achieved its intended purpose.
  <br><br>
        
### Validator Testing 
***
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]
<br><br>

### Unfixed Bugs
***
There are no unfixed bugs present within the website. 
<br><br>

### 404 Page Test
***
For the purposes of allowing the website reviewer to see the 404 page, the "email us" link on the home page purposely links to this. It would open up an email program to allow website users to email the allotment site otherwise.
<br><br>
## Deployment
***
Once the development process was well underway, the website was deployed to GitHub pages. In order to achieve this I: 

- Opened up the website repo in GitHub and opened the settings tab.
- The master branch was selected in the drop down menu to ensure my website was linked to correctly.
- Once this was selected the page is automatically deployed and the external website link is presented. 

The live link can be found here - https://graea85.github.io/Sprouton-Allotments/index.html
<br><br>
## Credits
***

* ### Code
<br>
The html and CSS code for the form was taken from https://colorlib.com/wp/template/colorlib-regform-3/. I then used my own custom CSS to redesign it to fit in with my website design and layout. I changed the image to a gardening themed image, added further form boxes to be relevant to my website and increased the radius of the borders. The image from the form is removed on smaller screen sizes for better UX design principles.
Bootstrap was used for all other code and styled using my own custom CSS. The home page layout is based on the bootstrap template at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/ and styled with custom CSS.
I referred to W3Schools and Stack Overflow when I encountered issues, which were primarily to do with layout issues and media queries. I have put in several custom media queries to deal with display issues on the IPad mini and Ipad Air, specifically in portrait mode.
<br><br>
